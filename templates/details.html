    <h1>ShuttleCash - Income Tax Estimator for North Carolinian Residents</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      ShuttleCash is a web application designed to help North Carolinian residents estimate their income tax for Tax Year 2024.
    </p>

    <h2>How Estimates are Calculated</h2>
    <p>
      For Tax Year 2024, the North Carolina individual income tax rate is 4.75% (0.0475).
      ShuttleCash applies this rate to the taxable income entered by the user to calculate the estimated tax amount.
    </p>

    <h2>Deductibles</h2>
    <p>
      A deductible is an amount of money that the taxpayer is allowed to subtract from their adjusted gross income (AGI) to reduce their taxable income.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Tax Year 2024, the deductible amounts are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single: $12,750</li>
      <li>Married Filing Jointly/Qualifying Widow(er)/Surviving Spouse: $25,500</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Itemized Deductions</h2>
    <p>
      Taxpayers have the option to either take the standard deduction or itemize their deductions.
      If you choose to itemize, you can deduct specific expenses such as medical expenses, state and local taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deductible amount will be calculated based on the total of your itemized deductions.
      If the total exceeds the standard deduction amount, you should opt for itemized deductions to lower your taxable income further.
